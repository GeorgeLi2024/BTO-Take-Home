0. Understand the problem; ask questions to ChatGPT; read documentation; do additional research and verification as needed
1. Use ChatGPT to generate design and test documentation
2. Work with ChatGPT to iteratively improve the design documentation
3. Use Cursor to design and verify a set of simple unit tests for the design
4. Use Cursor to implement the design
5. Manually verify the implementation

-Move from Cursor to the documentation to iteratively improve the design
-All coding/design had AI support in some form
-Very important to understand what is going on but it is more effective in practice to jump to the solution and work backwards
-In doing so you also understand how to move forwards
