Python CLI for Simple Variant Annotation

General Coding Guidelines
-------------------------
Use extremely simple beginner-friendly code that prioritizes readability, 
is easy to understand, and avoids complex logic. Add clear, concise 
1-line comments where relevant that are neither too simplistic nor 
overly technical.

Overview
--------
We will build a Python CLI tool that:
- Reads a list of RSIDs from a text file
- Sends a single batch API request to Ensembl for efficiency
- Outputs "n/a" in all fields for RSIDs that fail or are invalid
- Writes the results into a TSV output file

General Instructions
--------------------
The command line interface should:

- Accept a file with a list of dbSNP RSIDs and output a TSV file with annotations
- Query the Ensembl API using this endpoint https://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/vep_id_get
- Return the following fields: `start`, `end`, `most_severe_consequence` and a unique list of genes (pull from the `gene_symbol` value in the list of `transcript_consequences`)
    - To keep it simple, if multiple variants are returned just use the first one.

Implementation
-------------
1. Single File Structure
variant_annotator.py will contain:
- Function to read RSIDs from file
- Function to fetch annotations via batch API request
- Function to extract genes from annotations
- Function to process variants and write TSV output
- Simple CLI interface using sys.argv

2. Core Functions
- read_variants(file_path): Read RSIDs from file
- get_variant_annotations(rsids): Single batch API request
- extract_genes(annotation): Get unique gene symbols
- process_variants(input_file, output_file): Main processing flow

3. Error Handling
- Simple error handling: return N/A for any failures
- No retries or complex error recovery
- Basic file existence check

4. Dependencies
- requests: For API calls
- csv: For TSV output

Key Design Decisions
-------------------
- Single file for simplicity and maintainability
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Simple error handling (N/A for failures)
- No unnecessary features or complexity

Context
-------
- Ensembl API: https://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/variation_lookup
- Batch API: https://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/variation_lookup_batch
